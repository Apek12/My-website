Got it 👍 You want to create many webpages and connect them together with links (like a small website). Here’s a step-by-step guide:

🔗 How to Generate Multiple Webpages and Link Them

1. Plan Your Website

Decide how many pages you need.
Example:

index.html → Home page

about.html → About page

contact.html → Contact page

services.html → Services page



---

2. Create Each Webpage

Write simple HTML for each page. Example:

index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
    <a href="about.html">About</a> |
    <a href="services.html">Services</a> |
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
  </nav>
  <p>This is the homepage content.</p>
</body>
</html>


---

about.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>About Us</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
    <a href="about.html">About</a> |
    <a href="services.html">Services</a> |
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
  </nav>
  <p>This page tells about us.</p>
</body>
</html>

(Do the same for services.html and contact.html.)

3. Link Pages Together

Notice the <nav> section — that’s where links to all pages are.
You can copy-paste the same navigation menu on every page to make it easy to move around.


---

4. Folder Structure

Keep your files in one folder like this:

/my-website
   index.html
   about.html
   services.html
   contact.html


---

5. Open in Browser

Just double-click index.html → It opens in your browser.
From there, you can click links to go to other pages.


---

👉 Tip: If you want many pages quickly, you can copy one HTML file and just change the content + filename.

Do you want me to make a full example with 4–5 linked pages (all code ready to use), or just a template you can copy for unlimited pages?
